# Traverse
## The problem it solves
Traverse, our project for the 2024 Hackathon, aims to make going out with your friends a smoother and easier experience. Our goal was to create an app which would eliminate the question "...what next?" when out with your friends or visiting a new city. Traverse simplifies the travel planning process by enabling users to quickly create itineraries for both their local area and other cities across the US. It addresses the common frustration of filtering through numerous options for decent restaurants and activities. Users can effortlessly generate itineraries filled with top-rated and affordable activities with just the push of a button, allowing them to spend less time planning and more time enjoying their trip or outing. The platform allows users to select a state and city, and after searching, it displays the top tourist attractions in a list and on an interactive map. Airbnb listings are also integrated, with the best Airbnbs for the price and quality being prioritized, appearing on the bottom left of the screen for easy accommodation planning. Furthermore, Traverse offers deep insights into Airbnb data, analyzing top hosts and neighborhoods with violin plots, running regression models with an 80/20 train-test split, predicting prices based on independent variables, and visualizing listings on a heatmap. This comprehensive approach turns the cumbersome task of travel planning into a streamlined and enjoyable experience, providing all necessary tools and data in one convenient platform.
